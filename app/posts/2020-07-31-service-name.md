## Version 1

>V1 used "Apply for a large countryside productivity grant for water". This prototype only had water available.

This prototype only had water available.

We used this service name as the eligibility check, EOI journey and full application make up the application process. You can do the eligibility check and EOI now but must wait for the results of your EOI. Successful projects will get an invite to send in a full application.

We stuck with “expression of interest” as most of our users had applied for grants in the past and were familiar with the phrase.
