Start page for the large grants service. Based on the [start page pattern](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/start-pages/) in the gov.uk design system.

## Overview

### Hypotheses

Based on the design pattern, the start page needs to:

* tell them the name of service
* tell them what they have to do
* tell them what they need to know before they start
* include the Start now button
* give other ways to access the service

### User needs

As an applicant for a large grant, I need:

* to know if the project is eligible for a grant
* the service to be simple enough to apply by myself
* to know what information I will need to complete the eligibility checker and EOI before I start
* to understand exactly what this service is for and what I’m doing
* to know how long the eligibility check and EOI will take

## Version 1

{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [
    {
      text: "V1 start page",
      headingLevel: "3"
    }
  ]
}) }}

### User research

#### Key points

* Users expectations were not set well here
* 'Can I even apply' questions are distinct from those about how good a project is

#### Suggestions

Convey how it fits into the overall application and what they will know at the end

#### Participant comments

* P30 - the first step is are you eligible, no point looking at the project costs if I’m not eligible to apply … the first thing I turn to is the eligibility page and ask if I can, I haven’t wasted any time.
* P30 - make it clear up front what the processes are you’d have to go through, EOI, application etc.
* P30 - There’s a whole thing with eligibility around state aid rules. If I could link my SBI and BPS
* P30 - I would do an eligibility check as one thing and go through
* P31 - Would like to think it won’t take more than 20-30 mins if it’s an EOI
* P32 - once you press start does it save or do you have to start again?
* P33 - would like a list of things I would need to know
* P33 - brilliant that you’d be knowing how much time you’d be committing to

### Proposed design/content changes

* Modified journey so eligibility stuff (including theme eligibility first)
* Added messages to show that users can apply
* Add timelines - needs more research to make sure these are accurate
* Make it clear that they are only doing the eligibility check and expression of interest at this time
* Keep full application information separate as this will be done at a later date
* Add content to manage expectations so users know they are not guaranteed to get a grant.
* More messaging in the tasklist page
