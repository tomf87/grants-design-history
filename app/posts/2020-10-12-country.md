## Overview

### Hypothesis

Offer users the choice of areas in the United Kingdom, tell those not from England that they cannot apply and direct them to the relevant scheme in their region.

### User needs

As an applicant for a large grant, I need:

* to know if the project is eligible for a grant so that I donâ€™t waste time and money

As a government agency offering a large grant, I need:

* to check that the farm applying is eligible for the scheme
